## Course Description

When building modern web-applications, 
it's typically considered best-practice to include [unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) as a part of your development process. 
Such testing helps us to uncover problems early, reducing the effort required in fixing those defects, 
provide developers with a level of self-documenting code, 
and gives us a higher-level of quality of software.

In this course, we learn how to write unit testing for [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) web applications 
using two popular JavaScript testing frameworks: [QUnit]() and [Jasmine](). 
QUnit is a javascript test-driven development (TDD) framework while  
Jasmine is a javascript behavior-driven development (BDD) framework from Pivotal Labs.

Firstly, we explain exactly what is unit testing, why use it and 
what TDD and DBB are and the difference between them.

Secondly we look in details to QUnit and Jasmine.
Among the other things you will learn: how to make assertions, 
how to add structure to assertions, 
how to write fixtures,
how to test user interface elements, 
what are and how to write *suites*, *specifications* (specs) and *spies*.

Then, in this course we will use both BDD with TDD to write unit tests for a Backbone application.

Finally, this course will covers other important aspects of testing, 
such as performance, stress, security in order to verify that a  page with a large amount of JavaScript has no memory leaks, 
and that the application maintains its functional and performance expectations across multiple browsers.
