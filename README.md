Hands-On Unit Testing in JavaScript
============================

## Course Description

When building modern web-applications, 
it is typically considered best-practice to include [unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) 
as a part of your development process. 
Such a testing helps us to bring to light some problems early, 
reducing the effort required in fixing those defects, 
providing developers with a level of self-documenting code, 
and giving us a higher-level of software quality.

In this course, we learn how to write unit testing for [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) web applications 
using two popular JavaScript testing frameworks: [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). 
QUnit is a javascript test-driven development ([TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) framework while  
Jasmine is a javascript behavior-driven development ([BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)) 
framework from Pivotal Labs.

Firstly, we will precisely explain what unit testing is, why to use it,
what TDD and DBB are and the difference between them.

Secondly, we will analyze in detail QUnit and Jasmine.
Among other things you will learn, there are the following abilities: 
how to make assertions, 
how to add a structure to assertions, 
how to write fixtures,
how to test user interface elements, 
what *suites*, *specifications* (specs) and *spies* are and how to write them.

Then, in this course we will use both BDD and TDD to write unit tests for a Backbone application.

Finally, this course will cover other important aspects of testing, 
such as performance, stress, security in order to verify that a  page with a large amount of JavaScript has no memory leaks, 
and that the application maintains its functional and performance expectations across multiple browsers.
