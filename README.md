## Course Description

When building modern web-applications, 
it's typically considered best-practice to include automated testing as a part of your development process. 
Such testing, for example, helps support management of the application over time by ensuring that changes 
you make don't inadvertently affect other parts of the system.

In this course, we learn how to write automatic test for Backbone applications 
using two popular JavaScript testing frameworks: QUnit and Jasmine. 
QUnit is a javascript test-driven development (TDD) framework while  
Jasmine is a javascript behavior-driven development (BDD) framework from Pivotal Labs.
Firstly, we explain exactly what TDD and DBB are and the difference between them.
Secondly we look in details to QUnit and Jasmine: 
among the other things you will learn: how to make assertions, how to test user interface elements, 
what are and how to write Suites, specifications (specs) and spies.
Then, in this course we will use both BDD with TDD to write unit tests for a Backbone application.
Finally, this course will covers other important aspects of testing, such as performance, stress, security, automation and deployment.
